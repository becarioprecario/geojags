If you wish to distribute runtime libraries with the JAGS installer,
put the DLLs (*.dll) and, if required, the import libraries (*.dll.a)
in this subdirectory of the build tree.  They will be detected and
included in the installation.

This directory is for 32-bit files.  Use runtime64 for 64-bit files.
