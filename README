This package implements several spatial distributions for jags. The aim
is to provide the similar set of distributions available in the GeoBUGS
module for WinBUGS/OpenBUGS 
(http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/thebugs-project-geobugs/). The code in this packages is based on:

- jags source code (http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net)
- runjags package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/runjags/index.html)
- paper by Wabersich and Vandekerckhove (2014)
