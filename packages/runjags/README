The runjags package itself is entirely written in R, but it does contain
a JAGS module that provides additional distributions that must be
compiled for your system against a functional JAGS installation.  See
the platform specific instructions below for how to do this.

If you are unable to compile the C++ code and don't require the distributions
provided in the JAGS extension module, see the 'Compile-free' instructions 
at the end of this document.



Windows
-------

At compile time, there is no way for Windows to guess where the JAGS
library is installed, so you must supply the location yourself using
the make variable JAGS_ROOT, defining it in the file HOME/.R/Makevars.win
like so:

JAGS_ROOT=c:\Program Files\JAGS\JAGS-3.3.0

The configure script also needs to know the version of JAGS being used,
and will attempt to guess this from the JAGS_ROOT path.  If a non-
standard install path has been used you will need to provide the correct
JAGS major-version number like so:

JAGS_MAJOR_VERSION=3

The header files for the module itself should be able to detect the
version of JAGS installed on your system, but if you encounter compiler
errors it may help to specify JAGS_MAJOR_VERSION even if JAGS is 
installed in a standard directory - e.g. JAGS 4-beta requires:

JAGS_MAJOR_VERSION=4



Unix (including Mac OS X)
-------------------------

The configure script will try to guess the location of the JAGS
library installation. It will look in /<prefix>/<lib>, where

- <prefix> is the determined from the location of the jags
  script that launches the command line interface.

  For example, if this is "/usr/local/bin/jags", then prefix will
  be "/usr/local"

- <lib> is derived from the value of "LIBnn", returned by 
  "R CMD config LIBnn".

  This is particularly important on 64-bit unix, where R is 
  installed by default in /usr/local/lib64 and LIBnn is "lib64"

The configure script will also look for JAGS headers in
/<prefix>/include/JAGS

If the configure script fails to find the JAGS headers or library,
you can set the environment variables JAGS_INCLUDE and JAGS_LIB
to point to the correct directory.

The header files for the module itself should be able to detect the
version of JAGS installed on your system, but a JAGS_MAJOR_VERSION
environmental variable can be set in case of problems which may be
encountered with some versions of JAGS - e.g. JAGS 4-beta requires:

export JAGS_MAJOR_VERSION=4
R CMD install runjags...



Compile-free
------------

The standard version of the runjags package includes a JAGS
extension module providing additional distributions in the Pareto
family (amongst others).  

If you want to install runjags without the additional JAGS module,
then you can simply remove the configure(.ac) files and entire src
directory before running R CMD install runjags...  This does not
require any C++ compilers, or even for JAGS to be installed on
your system.

Alternatively there is a version of runjags with the JAGS module 
removed hosted on the sourceforge page for runjags at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/runjags/).
