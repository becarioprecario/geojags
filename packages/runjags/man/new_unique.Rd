\title{Create a Unique Filename}
\description{
   Search the current working directory for a file or directory matching
   the input name, and if it exists suggest a new name by appending a
   counter to the input name.  Alternatively, the function can ask the
   user if the existing file should be overwritten, in which case the
   existing file will be erased if the answer is 'yes'.  The function
   also checks for write access permissions at the current working
   directory.
}
\usage{
new_unique(name = NA, suffix = "", ask = FALSE, 
prompt = "A file or directory with this name already exists.  Overwrite?",
touch=FALSE, type='file')
}
\arguments{

\item{name}{the filename to be used (character string).  A vector of
character strings is also permissible, in which case they will be pasted
together.  One or more missing (NA) values can also be used, which will
be replaced with a randomly generated 9 character alphanumeric string. 
Default NA.}

\item{suffix}{the file extension (including '.') to use (character
string).  If this does not start with a '.', one will be prepended
automatically.  Default none.}

\item{ask}{if a file exists with the input name, should the function ask
to overwrite the file? (logical)  If FALSE, a new filename is used
instead and no files will be over-written.  Default FALSE.}

\item{prompt}{what text string should be used to prompt the user?
(character string)  Ignored is ask==FALSE.  A generic default is
supplied.}

\item{touch}{option to create (touch) the file/folder after generating
the unique name, which prevents other processes from sneaking in and
creating a file with the same name before the returned filename has had
chance to be used.  Default FALSE.}

\item{type}{if touch==TRUE, then type controls if a file or directory is
created.  One of 'file', 'f', 'directory', or 'd'.  Defult 'file'.}
